# Developing A Package For CTAN

This is an experimental static site using mdbook.  Submissions are not accepted at this time.  At present this is very likely going to be used for documenting the process of forking an item on CTAN to be used as a downstream package to be called `samizdat`.  It won't be pretty but there needs to be a way to get news out in a quick and dirty fashion.

Consult the work on Launchpad in the [auto-newspaper](https://code.launchpad.net/~skellat/+git/auto-newspaper) project.  If you clone this repository please make sure you use the command `git clone --recurse-submodules` to ensure you pick up the `auto-newspaper` submodule that is being included with this repository.  Things will get interesting, it seems.

Oddly enough, writing this in Markdown does make it possible to still take the text and typeset it later using LaTeX thanks to the [markdown](https://ctan.org/pkg/markdown) package.

Time isn't the most available for this...
